<h2>Step 1 - Set Up (Download) Qualys and Nessus</h2> 

Nessus, developed by Tenable, is a powerful vulnerability scanning tool used for identifying security weaknesses in networks and systems. It offers detailed reports and guidance for remediation, making it popular among cybersecurity professionals. Qualys, on the other hand, is a cloud-based cybersecurity platform known for its suite of solutions including vulnerability management, compliance management, and threat protection. It provides scalable and centralized security solutions, making it a preferred choice for enterprises aiming to strengthen their security posture and ensure regulatory compliance.

Qualys offers a free trial on their website (https://www.qualys.com/). You do need a business email to sign up. I did not record the steps throughout this particular part of the process but, essentially you'll sign up, Qualys will send you a couple links to your email, and you'll follow those to receive  your account info. Once you get all this squared away, you'll arrive at your dashboard which should look like this:

Next, I downloaded **Nessus** and set that up on my desktop computer. Nessus also asked for a business email. I used my domain from my online resume which I can show you how to set up if you need.  Here is the link to download Nessus: https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?utm_source=nessus-trial-thank-you-update&loginAttempted=true. Run the installer and then you should get a browser that opens to Nessus. When you get the "Unsecure Browser" warning, go ahead and click **Advanced** and then **Proceed to browser**. Nessus appears as an unsecured site, but Nessus provides a self-signed SSL certificate that will maintain confidentiality. 

On the first pop up, click **Continue**

On the next window, you should choose the option that applies to you. I only used a free trial, so I chose **Start a trial of Nessus Expert**.

If you selected the free trial selection as I did, at the bottom of this page, click **Continue**

Now, we should have **Qualys** and **Nessus** downloaded and ready to be configured.
