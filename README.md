<h2>Step 1 - Set Up Nessus</h2> 

Nessus, developed by Tenable, is a powerful vulnerability scanning tool used for identifying security weaknesses in networks and systems. It offers detailed reports and guidance for remediation, making it popular among cybersecurity professionals. I downloaded **Nessus** and set that up on my desktop computer. Nessus does ask for a business email. I used my domain from my online resume which I can show you how to set up if you need.  Here is the link to download Nessus: https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?utm_source=nessus-trial-thank-you-update&loginAttempted=true. Run the installer and then you should get a browser that opens to Nessus. When you get the "Unsecure Browser" warning, go ahead and click **Advanced** and then **Proceed to browser**. Nessus appears as an unsecured site, but Nessus provides a self-signed SSL certificate that will maintain confidentiality. 

On the first pop-up, click **Continue**

On the next window, you should choose the option that applies to you. I only used a free trial, so I chose **Start a trial of Nessus Expert**.

If you selected the free trial selection as I did, at the bottom of this page, click **Continue**

<h2>Step 2 - Create Scan</h2>

Next, I created just a basic scan of my network. On the **My Scans** page, in the top right of the banner you should see **+ New Scan**, click it.

You should be redirected to the **Scan Templates** page.

I began with a basic network scan. On the Scan Templates page, click on **Advanced Scan**. Name your scan whatever you'd like and write a quick description. In the bottom box for **Targets**, this is where you will put your IPv4 address(es). Click, **Save**.

<h2>Step 3 - Run Scan</h2>

Back at the **My Scans** page, select the scan you just created, and in the banner you should see a button with **More** pop up. Hover your mouse over it and click, **Launch**

Allow the scan to run it's course and check back periodically to see if it has finished. You can check on the scan's progress by clicking on your scan and you will get a progress meter that looks like this:

<h2>Step 4 - Analyze Scan Results</h2>

Once the scan is complete, you will be able to what types of vulnerabilities were found on your host network. The bar graph's colors represent the severity of the vulnerabilities found. We are then able to navigate to the **Vulnerabilities** tab and get in-depth looks at each found vulnerability.

Click on one of your vulnerabilities.

Nessus will provide you with descriptions, solutions, risk information, and vulnerability information for each vulnerability. 

<h2>Step 5 - Remediate Vulnerability</h2>

This part will be individualized for you and your system. For the sake of this project, I will continue to document the steps I took to remediate the found vulnerability on my network. To remediate the **"SMB Signing not required"** vulnerability, I ran **Prompt** and searched, **gpedit.msc** to open the local group policy.

Next, I used the drop-down menu expansions to navigate to the following path: **Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options**.

Then, I clicked on **â€˜Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always).** By default, this setting is usually  disabled. Double-click on it and change it to enabled.

<h2>Step 6 - Rescan the Host</h2>

The last thing I did was create a new scan and rescan the network to ensure I alleviated the found vulnerability. I successfully remediated the SMB Signing vulnerability.
