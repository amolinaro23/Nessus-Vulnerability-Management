<h2>Step 1 - Set Up (Download) Qualys and Nessus</h2> 

Nessus, developed by Tenable, is a powerful vulnerability scanning tool used for identifying security weaknesses in networks and systems. It offers detailed reports and guidance for remediation, making it popular among cybersecurity professionals. Qualys, on the other hand, is a cloud-based cybersecurity platform known for its suite of solutions including vulnerability management, compliance management, and threat protection. It provides scalable and centralized security solutions, making it a preferred choice for enterprises aiming to strengthen their security posture and ensure regulatory compliance.

Qualys offers a free trial on their website (https://www.qualys.com/). You do need a business email to sign up. I did not record the steps throughout this particular part of the process but, essentially you'll sign up, Qualys will send you a couple links to your email, and you'll follow those to receive  your account info. Once you get all this squared away, you'll arrive at your dashboard which should look like this:

Next, I downloaded **Nessus** and set that up on my desktop computer. Nessus also asked for a business email. I used my domain from my online resume which I can show you how to set up if you need.  Here is the link to download Nessus: https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?utm_source=nessus-trial-thank-you-update&loginAttempted=true. Run the installer and then you should get a browser that opens to Nessus. When you get the "Unsecure Browser" warning, go ahead and click **Advanced** and then **Proceed to browser**. Nessus appears as an unsecured site, but Nessus provides a self-signed SSL certificate that will maintain confidentiality. 

On the first pop up, click **Continue**

On the next window, you should choose the option that applies to you. I only used a free trial, so I chose **Start a trial of Nessus Expert**.

If you selected the free trial selection as I did, at the bottom of this page, click **Continue**

Now, we should have **Qualys** and **Nessus** downloaded and ready to be configured. 

<h2>Step 2 - Configure Qualys Scan</h2>

Once you have both scanners downloaded, go to Qualys and click on **Add IP Addresses to scan** on the Vulnerability Management page.

Next, we need to add the Host IPs and the ranges for which we will be scanning. **REMINDER - ENSURE YOU HAVE PERMISSION TO SCAN ON THE NETWORK FOR WHICH YOU ARE CONDUCTING THIS LAB. SCANNING NETWORKS WITHOUT PERMISSION IS ILLEGAL.** On the pop-out navigation pane, click on **Host IPs** and enter the IPv4 address that you're scanning. Once you've added the IP address, scroll to the bottom and click **Add**.

Next, back on the Vulnerability Management screen, click on **Configure scanner appliances**.

In the top left corner of the window, you should see **New** with a dropdown menu. Select, **Virtual Scanner Appliance** and you should get this window:

Name your scan whatever you'd like and in the **Choose a Virtualization Platform** menu select, **VMware ESXi, vCenter Server (standard)** and click next.

You should get an automatic download for the virtual scanner image. Check your downloads, and if it did not begin to download, you can click the hyperlink in the popup window. Once the download completes, scroll to the bottom of the popup window and click **Next**.

Keep your personalization code somewhere safe. You will need it after you launch your virtual appliance from your visualization environment. After you've saved your personalization code, scroll down and click **Check Activation**. You should get this screen next.

 <h2>Step X - Configure Nessus</h2>
